Difference between functional Programming and Object Orient Programming


Functions are first class citizens


What do first class citizens means?

Consider the following code:

---------------------------------
Now let's think about the Objects : pass, assign, return value
---------------------------------
 
Student student = new Student("name", roll-no);
Here Student is an Object. 
Point # 1 : I am able to store student object in a variable.
Point # 2 : I am able to invoke methods of a variable.
For example: student.getNumberOfMarks();

Point # 3 : We can pass the object as a data to a method.
For example: System.out.println(student)

--------------------------------------------
Now let's think about a function or a method : pass, return value, assign
--------------------------------------------
Point # 1 : Will I be able to pass a function as a parameter to a method.
Point # 2 : Will I be able to get a function as a return value from a method
Point # 3 : Can I assign a function to a variable

This is why functional programming comes into play to solve the above 3 problems.
